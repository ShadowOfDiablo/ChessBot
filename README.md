# ChessBot
I took on the chess challenge trying to make a C# bot that works properly. 
It doesn't work as well as I imagined, but my little brother likes playing against it, so I am happy about how it turned out!
The bot uses C#, which is the programming language that I am studying at school.
In case you want to play against it, download the zip and open it in your IDE, find the src foulder in the Chess-Challenge one and then navigate to MyBot.cs
